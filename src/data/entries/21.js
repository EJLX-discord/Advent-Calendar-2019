<p>Hello all, I&#39;m Chroma.
This is first time talking in Advent Calender.
So, My topic is, &quot;Oldschool FTW&quot;.</p>
<p>I really like niche hardware that&#39;s uncommon on this days.
Like 1980&#39;s defacto-standard CPU, Motorola&#39;s 68000, Alongside with Zilog Z80.
Or like, overused Yamaha FM synthesizer IC, YM2412, YM2612, YM2413…
also, GameBoy, NES, SNES… whatever those.</p>
<p>It&#39;s fun to code so-called &quot;homebrew&quot; too into something like NES, SNES, Megadrive.</p>
<p>It have very sophiscated community focused into research of new techniques, and developing new tools to aid (Insert whatever you want to do, like music creation).</p>
<p>NES have variety of tools, like assembler, FamiTracker(to make music), and even template.</p>
<p>Megadrive have SGDK, which can make homebrew on C. and also having sound driver to do 4 PCM sound at once(!).</p>
<p>though all of this, I&#39;m still eager to R&amp;D on old hardware.
And coding on obscure system is, &quot;fun&quot;.</p>
<p>Anyway, this marks end of messy Advent calender entry.</p>
<p><em>P.S. Love touhou, everyone should play it</em></p>
