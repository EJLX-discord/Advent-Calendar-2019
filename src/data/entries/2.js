`<p><strong>Advent Calendar: the 8th of December 2019</strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Where do you want to go?</strong><p>
<p>Hello everyone! Of course, I entered Advent Calendar event this year too!
This year, I chose &quot;Where do you want to go&quot; because I really want to go to so many places with.... my improved English skill :yuriLoser:
My imaginary traveling starts now!!! Heeeeeeheee!!!</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Hawaii (U.S.)</strong></p>
<p>Have you ever visited Hawaii?
I&#39;ve never visited overseas but I really want to go to Hawaii because I really love warm places.
There are lots of beautiful beaches, and blue sky, and blue waters...
I&#39;ve visited Okinawa once, it was a really really really lovely place and I did snorkeling with my friends! And it was amazing... I really loved Okinawa but at the same time, I started wanting to swim more in warm and beautiful seas! So my #1 is Hawaii. Absolutely!</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Milan, Sicily (Italy)</strong></p>
<p>This desire has been my #1 since I saw the city&#39;s atmosphere on the Japanese TV documentary till I swam in the Okinawa sea.
Milan, then you guys surely know that orange...? red... brown-ish historical houses, buildings are there.
And I saw this on the TV show. Some really skilled violin, wood base, guitar players were playing such romantic music. Like &quot;Autumn leaves&quot; etc etc.
They were assimilated into Milan&#39;s atmosphere, more like, they were making Milan a more beautiful place.
I really love music so I want to go and I want to shout &quot;Bravo!&quot; like BrraVVoooo!
I want to go to Sicily because I love Tokyo Disney Sea. Plus the same reason as Milan.
And sorry, this is En/Jp server though I wanted to write Bravo.
Ahem.. please remember this server is En/Jp and don&#39;t use other lang--COUGH COUGH
Seriously.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>California, Nevada (U.S.)</strong></p>
<p>Wow I wanted to go to other places too though this post is much too long.... So my final visiting is the United States of AMEEERICA!!!
California is really attractive for me, because I don&#39;t like cold places and there are always sunny, cloudy or whatever warm places.
I also don&#39;t like rainy days. I have really sensitive mind and the rain makes me sa--COUGH
Also I really love Full House. That city&#39;s buildings are really... crowded, accurate, minute. And of course having good atmosphere.
I want to walk on Golden gate bridge, go to Fisherman&#39;s wharf, Little Tokyo, Disney Land, Las Vegas Strip and CASINOs heeheeee!!
Especially Las Vegas Strip is my longing right now.
I probably can spend 1 week for just walking Las Vegas Strip.
I really like decorative illuminations!! there are so many fancy decorations on that street, and I want to just... just see them forever.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you for reading this really long post!
Also I want to go to GB, Maldives, Netherlands, more like every country.</p>
