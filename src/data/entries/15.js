`<p><strong>My favorite thing</strong></p>
<p>What if you could travel to other countries without going anywhere?
No, it's not virtual reality I'm talking about.
It is a book, reading.
It could take you wherever you want to go.
It could make you whatever you want to be.</p>
<p>I used to read books in Japanese.
My favorite genre is romantic suspense, but it's not popular genre in Japan, unfortunately.
Most of books I read were translated ones from English to Japanese.
Sometimes they had a sequel that would take for months to be translated into Japanese .</p>
<p>One day, I felt like I couldn't wait until the day the translated sequel would be published.
I don't remember which book it was.
I decided to buy the book and read it in English.
My English journey has started there.</p>
<p>The first book took me about six months to finish.
I had to look up a dictionary each time I encountered the new words.
It sometimes took me a week to read only one page.
Although reading the first English book was hard and tough, it gave me a satisfaction 
that I was able to feel what the author wanted to tell us through her own words.</p>
<p>Reading a translated book is fun but it can be said that the translated book could be affected by the translator's ideas or thoughts.
I had been feeling like I couldn't get the authors intention directly if I read it through the translator's eyes.</p>
<p>Since then, I've been reading books in English.
Sometimes I was a sniper protecting my loved one in the middle of jungle.
Sometimes I was traveling with a drop dead gorgeous handsome guy in the freezing Alaska.</p>
<p>Books give us so many opportunities and adventures that you might not be able to experience in your life.
Once you open books, you would realize that you are in other worlds.
Are you sold?
then, why don't you go into the world of books with me?</p>
