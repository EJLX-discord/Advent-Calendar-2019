My favorite thing</strong></p>
<p>Do you know &quot;Tumami zaiku(つまみ細工）&quot;?
It&#39;s one of the traditional handcrafts in Japan.
It is made by folding small pieces of square cloths.
It is usually made for hair accessories of kimono.
Those are very beautiful, but very expensive because of handcrafting.
Lately, I&#39;m into making them.
I basically love to make something by myself.
Maybe, I wrote about a leathercraft last year.
I still love to make leathercraft, but this year, making tsumami-zaiku was added to my favorite things as well.
The chance that I started making them is a coming-of-age ceremony for my daughter.
She become 20 years old next year. And a lot of Japanese girl who will be 20 years old wear Kimono when they go to the ceremony.
So, I made some hair accessories for my daughter and she wore them when she took a commemorative photos.
We usually take such photos before ceremony because they are very busy on that day.
Anyway, I&#39;m glad she wore them and also she will become an adult.</p>
