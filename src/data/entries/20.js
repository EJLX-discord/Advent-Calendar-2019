const entry = `<p><strong>Advent Calendar: the 25th of December 2019.
&quot;1.My favorite thing&quot; and  &quot;2.My New Year&#39;s Resolution&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Merry Christmas!
Did you get a present from Santa Claus? 
Or did you become Santa Claus for someone?
...Me? Of course, he hasn&#39;t come to my house yet.
By the way, it’s my first time participating in this kind of event. So I&#39;m very nervous and my palms are sweaty. But I’m going to do my best. Ok, let&#39;s go!</p>
<p><strong>1.My favorite thing</strong></p>
<p>I love animals, cartoons, Japanese animes, novels, editing videos and drawing art.
Especially, cartoons are very special for me, but today is Christmas day so I&#39;ll talk about my memories.
When I was in elementary school, I wrote a letter to Santa Claus in December.
&quot;I&#39;ll be a good kid, so I want to get the game to grow hamsters&quot;(yes, I liked games)
The present was on the side of my pillow. 
A few years later, in December, I wrote a letter to him again. 
&quot;I want to get the game of Harvest Moon&quot;
But unfortunately, the present wasn&#39;t on the side of my pillow. I was sad. Then, my father said
&quot;Ah, I just saw Santa Claus. He seems to be in a hurry and put something in the post&quot;
I heard father&#39;s words, I was sure that Santa Claus doesn&#39;t exist in this world!!
The present was truly in the post...
Though I was sad, I thought my heart had grown up in this happening.
Then, I decided to give a present to my family instead of getting it. I realized it was important to think about someone. 
In December of this year, I bought a small and easy to use a mixer for my mother. I plan to share and use it.
Yes, Santa Claus always exists in my(your) heart.</p>
<p><strong>2.My New Year&#39;s Resolution</strong></p>
<p>-Writing short  novels in English
-Creating short videos
I like to use Adobe.  I want to create short animation videos  on Adobe animation. I don&#39;t know if I can come true, but I&#39;m very interested now. First of all, I must buy a new PC!</p>
<p>Thank you for reading my Advent Calendar !!</p>`
