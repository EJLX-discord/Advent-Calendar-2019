<p>I hope I was able to improve my English skills compared with last year.</p>
<ol><li><strong>My favourite things:</strong>
I like traveling. Especially going abroad is so fun since when hearing foreign languages and seeing buildings that are different from Japanese ones, I feel like I&#39;m completely away from the bustle of everyday life. What I mainly do while traveling abroad is visiting museums and eating. 
I’m also into art. I used to have zero interest on art when I was in my teens. So I couldn’t understand why people bother to waste their time just watching pictures that don’t even move. I majored in economics and politics in university because they looked “practical” and art thingies didn’t seem to have something to do with them. However,  after I took a movie class and watched a lot of movies, I gradually came to admit that art is an essential aspect of human nature. As historically the first drama was played in Greek theatre in front of all the Athenian citizens, human activities inherently consist of art that has imposed its huge influence on our culture since the earliest stage of human era. In short, Now I can enjoy art because I know you have to consider an artwork as a product of relationships between the artist and the world. Plato said something like “Artists are those who interpret the acts of the God since everything on the earth is created by him although the hidden meanings of creatires aren’t visible for most people.” I think you can regard the word “God” he used as the world instead. We are a part of the world, therefore artworks depict us in defferent ways depending on the time, situation, culture, production style, artist’s personal character and so on. Anyway, what I’m trying to say is enjoying art doesn’t mean just standing still in front of the artwork. It’s more than that.</li>
<li><strong>My new year’s resolution:</strong>
To be honest, I have never traveled by myself. I didn’t like Onsen(hot springs) so I hardly ever go on a donestic trip other than club camps or school trips. It might be just me, but in my opinion most Japanese people who prefer local trips are obsessed with hot springs, which I used to regard as a waste of time and money as you have a bath in your house. Instead, I wanted to make my trip more active and productive, such as visiting a tourist spot or eating at the popular restaurant.
As for eating, it’s much less fun than sharing a table with someone because you can’t share food and opinions. (This reminds me of a movie quote, “Happiness becomes real when shared”) Especially for dinner, you can’t choose a fancy restaurant as it makes you feel even lonely. So all things considered, solo trip wasn’t appealing very much.
Even though, for some reason, I changed my mind out of sudden. It may be because I came to go to the museum and cinema by myself. Now that I think going on a trip by myself is amusing since you don’t have to care about your girlfriend that always complains on your decision and friends that have different taste or thoughts. You can change your plan anytime on a whim, sleep until noon in your bed or read a book in train as much as you want. It’d be appreciated if someone who read this article gave me any recommendations on the destination.</li>
</ol><p>Lastly, happy new year to everyone in the server! I enjoyed a lot with you all this year. Thank you very much. I hope everything goes well.</p>`
